**Backend Developer @ BizLoom** | Building scalable Node.js systems in production

Currently architecting warranty management systems handling enterprise clients. Previously reduced API response times by 70% through strategic optimization.

## ðŸš€ What I Do

I write backend code that scales. Currently maintaining production APIs at BizLoom serving industrial clients, with a focus on performance and reliability.

**Daily Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis  
**Specialties**: API design, database optimization, auth systems, real-time features

## ðŸ“Š Impact & Metrics

```yaml
Production Experience: 8+ months shipping real features to real users
Performance: Achieved sub-200ms response times for complex MongoDB aggregations  
Code Quality: Maintain 85-90% test coverage across projects
Problem Solving: LeetCode top 15% (450+ problems) - Yes, I can reverse a binary tree
```
